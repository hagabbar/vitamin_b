Welcome to VItamin_B, a python toolkit for producing fast gravitational wave posterior samples.

Package is based off of the paper "Bayesian Parameter Estimation using Conditional Variational 
Autoencoders for Gravitational Wave Astronomy" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06296)

Note: This repository is a work in progress. No official release of code just yet.
